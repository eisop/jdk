/**
 * Indicates that the effective mutability is determined by viewpoint adaptation from the receiver.
 *
 * <p>On a member type, {@code @ReceiverDependentMutable} is a placeholder that is replaced by the
 * mutability of the receiver at a use site. On an object creation expression, the created object's
 * mutability is determined by the target type. On a class declaration, the class may be used at
 * different mutability instantiations, such as {@code @Mutable} or {@code @Immutable}.
 *
 * <p>This qualifier is only meaningful where there is a receiver or target context from which PICO
 * can determine a concrete mutability.
